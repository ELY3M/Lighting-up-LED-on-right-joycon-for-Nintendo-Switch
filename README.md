# lighting up the led on right joycon. 


I saw some post on some forums about this unknown function.  
I found this code at switchbrew's github.  
https://github.com/switchbrew/switch-examples/pull/54
Thanks to CTCaer and yellows8 for the original code :)  

I added 2 of my own flashing patterns :)   

This code will only work on switches with custom OS and homebrew.
